# Numerical-Methods
Computational Electromagnetics &amp; Photonics
I'm working on a master project on the topic "micromagnetic models"
It deals with numerical methods concept
The work is about about modelling a stack of layers which consists of magnetic and nn-magnetic layers
The project studies comparision between three different standard models
My work is to simply design a free layer using a software called "Magnum.fe" (FeNics)
Neverthless, the project work includes the literature work of these  mentioned standard models
My ongoing work is to learn Magnum.fe and standar models...
